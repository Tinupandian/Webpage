                <p>Sushmitha, my dear friend, is an understanding soul who has been by my side for the past two years, guiding me, caring for me, <br> and lighting up my world with her presence.
                    Last year, I missed celebrating her birthday, but this time, I refuse to let the opportunity slip away.<br> <br>

                    When I think of Vijayawada, I can't help but recall the countless fun-filled moments we've shared together.<br>
                     Whether it's exploring the city's hidden gems or simply basking in each other's company, being with Sushmitha always brings joy to my heart.<br>
                      Our conversations are filled with laughter and nostalgia, as we reminisce about the beautiful memories we've created together.<br> <br>

                    One thing I never expected was the strong bond that has formed between us. From the moment we first met in the temple,<br>
                     it was as if the universe conspired to bring us together. Despite starting our journey as friends in 10th standard, our connection has only grown stronger<br> over the past six years,
                      despite the ups and downs life has thrown our way.<br> <br>

                      Even during times when we drifted apart, I knew deep down that Sushmitha would always be there for me, ready to pick up right where we left off. <br>
                      Our friendship is a testament to the enduring power of love, trust, and understanding.<br> <br>

                      So, on this special day, I want to express my deepest gratitude to Sushmitha for being the incredible friend that she is. With her by my side,<br>
                       I know that life's challenges seem less daunting and its joys more profound.<br> Here's to many more years of laughter, adventures, and cherished memories together. <br> <br>
